# Testing Assumptions of Linear Regression on Google's stock data from the past decade

This iPython notebook demonstrates how to test assumptions of Linear Regression once you've trained a Linear Model 

I've taken Google's stock data from the past decade, and modelled the price using Linear Regression. I've furthered analysed the model for voilations of assumptions of Linear Regression, and then made appropriate modifications to my model so that it it doesn't violate the assumptions.
